// If the Technical/Instrumentation cells already render by ColumnState -> badge/spinner,
// Creative column will now work automatically. Ensure it reads row.creative.state.
// (No UI change required if it already mirrors other columns.)

// NOTE: The actual table rendering is implemented in renderer.js in the updateQueueDisplay() function.
// This TypeScript file serves as a placeholder for future TypeScript migration.
// The Creative column is already implemented and working with the progressStatus tracking system.
